# Sales Dashboard (Excel)
Hi 👋  
This is a simple and clean sales dashboard I built using Microsoft Excel to practice data analysis and dashboard design.

The goal of this project wasn’t to overcomplicate things — just to present key business insights clearly and visually.


 📊 What this dashboard shows
- Sales by category
- Profit trend over time
- Monthly sales performance
- Top 5 customers by profit
- Sales by state (map view)
- Interactive slicers for Year and Category


🛠 Tools & Skills Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Charts & Slicers
- Basic data cleaning & organization



📁 File Structure
- `Sales_Dashboard.xlsx` → Main interactive dashboard  
  *(Backend pivot tables and calculations are kept in hidden sheets to keep the dashboard clean.)*
- `dashboard_preview.png` → Screenshot preview of the dashboard
- `raw_data.xlsx` → Source data used for analysis *(optional reference)*


🧠 Why this project?
I wanted to get comfortable with:
- Turning raw data into insights
- Designing dashboards that are simple, readable, and not overwhelming
- Using Excel the “right way” (frontend dashboard + backend logic)

Nothing fancy — just solid fundamentals done properly 🙂
Thanks for checking it out!
